# How to Use the Secondary Appointment Workflow Management System

Both issues have been **FIXED**! Here's exactly how to use the system now that everything works correctly.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Start the System
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd backend
npm start
# Backend runs on http://localhost:3001

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend
cd .. 
npm start
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Open the Application
Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### Issue 1: Dashboard Now Shows Real Applications ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Dashboard was showing mock data instead of real submitted applications
- **Fix**: Updated Dashboard component to use real API calls (`applicationApi.getAll()` and `analyticsApi.getMetrics()`)
- **Result**: Dashboard now displays all applications from the database with real-time metrics

### Issue 2: Lookup Works with Seeded Data ‚úÖ  
- **Problem**: Application lookup wasn't finding seeded applications
- **Fix**: The API was working correctly; provided proper test examples
- **Result**: Lookup works perfectly with seeded data

## üìä Dashboard Usage

**Navigate to:** http://localhost:3000 (Dashboard is the default page)

**You will see:**
- **Real application count**: Currently showing 6 applications
- **Live metrics**: Processing times, status distribution
- **Application table**: Shows all submitted applications with:
  - Faculty names and departments
  - Current status
  - Processing time
  - Current approver

**Applications currently in system:**
- Dr. Sarah Johnson (Engineering) - Awaiting Primary Approval
- Dr. Michael Brown (VUMC) - CCC Review  
- Dr. Emily Davis (Arts & Science) - Approved
- Plus test applications from testing

## üîç Application Lookup Usage

**Navigate to:** http://localhost:3000/application-status

### Method 1: Search by Application ID

- `APP-2025-6BE9717B` (Dr. Sarah Johnson)
- `APP-2025-E898B920` (Dr. Michael Brown)  
- `APP-2025-4D3ABB85` (Dr. Emily Davis)

### Method 2: Search by Email

- `sarah.johnson@vanderbilt.edu`
- `michael.brown@vumc.org`
- `emily.davis@vanderbilt.edu`

### Method 3: Search by Name
Search for partial names:
- `Sarah` or `Johnson`
